# ErrPref Release Notes Version 0.0.0

This version of ***ErrPref*** was compiled and tested using Go 1.15.8.

Not much to see here folks. This is the first release of the 'errpref'
package. 

All tests are passing, and beginning tomorrow, I will be using the types
provided here in a real-world environment. 

Stay tuned ...
